This repository contains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model implemented in Python using scikit-learn for classifying text documents into 10 different categories based on a news dataset. The classification task is performed using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique for preprocessing the text data.

## Key Features

- **SVM Classifier:** The model employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, a popular choice for text classification tasks due to its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces.
  
- **TF-IDF Preprocessing:** Text data preprocessing is performed using the TF-IDF technique, which represents the importance of a term within a document relative to a collection of documents, effectively capturing the significance of words in each document.

- **10-Class Classification:** The model is trained to classify text documents into 10 distinct categories, covering a diverse range of news topics such as sports, business, entertainment, technology, politics, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the SVM model consists of a curated collection of news articles categorized into 10 classes. Each document is preprocessed using TF-IDF vectorization to transform text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms.
